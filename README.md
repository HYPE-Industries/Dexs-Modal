# Dexs-Modal
Dexs, or Decks is a simple modal js library. Built completly with HTML DOM objects, and having no depenencies, Dexs is a super tiny modal libary. This libary was brought to you by <a href="https://PolarComputersInc.com">Polar Computers Inc.</a> and the Pace Software Team. This project wouldn't have be possible without the amazing insperation from <a href="https://micromodal.now.sh/">MicroModal</a>, <a href="https://github.hubspot.com/vex/">Vex Modal</a>, and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Modal</a>. With the help of contrubitors and the Pace Team at Polar, we keep this libary uptodate.

## What is Dexs?
Dexs, is a simple modal library. It is super tiny, and isn't reliant on Bootstrap or jQuery. Making it perfect for a super simple project. We made Dexs while working on the Pace Productive Suite. While, we all love the Bootstrap and jQuery libraries, they are large and bulky and we didn't need many components from them. So we build our own Javascript libary to solve our promblems. But Dexs, was designed with a lot more in mind, other than being slim. One of the biggest things we needed was the ability to open multiple modals and them to stack ontop each other. What we needed was for you able to open one modal, then open a second. When closing the second, go back to the first. We call this layering of modals, a stack.

## Installation
Installing Dexs is super simple too. Just add the libary and your are ready to go. We highly recommend once you have downloaded the files, you minify them, this will decrease the size of the files.
